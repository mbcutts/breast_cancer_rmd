#Loading Data and Preprocessing - Data Description

data(BreastCancer)
di <- describe(BreastCancer)
head(BreastCancer)
#no missing data points, all points are numeric, however there is an ID variable which we will throw out for training.
#9 training variables
#Got data set from mlbench!

#Training and Testing Split (75/25)
```{r}
#consulted https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17200114/how-to-split-data-into-training-testing-sets-using-sample-function for this problem. Was looking for a built in function for R to do this but this manual method works just as well.
sample_size <- floor(nrow(BreastCancer) * 0.75)
set.seed(12345)
training_indices <- sample(seq_len(nrow(BreastCancer)), size = sample_size)
response = c("Class")

train <- BreastCancer[training_indices, ]
test <- BreastCancer[-training_indices, ]
trainX <- select (train, -Class)
trainY<- select (train, Class)
testX <- select (test, -Class)
testY<- select (test, Class)

### add network architecture
NN_model_1 %>% layer_dense(units = 28,  activation ='sigmoid', input_shape = ) %>%
